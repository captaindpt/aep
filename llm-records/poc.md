⚡ Tonight’s “AEP-for-LLMs” Proof-of-Concept

⸻

0 · TL;DR (why, what, how)

In one evening we’ll bolt a 15-line AEP emitter onto a tiny LangChain RAG app, collect real focus_ms events while we interrogate it, and show—in a Jupyter notebook—that re-ranking by attention beats vanilla similarity search.
Deliverables: a git repo you can run with docker compose up, a .aep ledger you can open in Grafana/DuckDB, and a notebook that prints “Precision@5: 0.76 → 0.87 (+11 pp)”.

1 · What the demo is

Section	Short description
Dataset	docs/ folder with 50–100 Markdown files (we’ll grab the LangChain docs dump—small but realistic).
Baseline app	A 40-line Python script using LangChain VectorstoreRetriever + OpenAI chat completion to answer ad-hoc questions.
AEP tap	Custom AEPCallbackHandler (≈15 LOC) that:   on_llm_end → computes exec latency → writes one ND-MsgPack line {id, ts, focus_ms, payload}.
Ledger side-car	Simple file append at ~/.aep/demo.aep (gzip every 1 MB rotation).
Attention weighting	Runnable notebook that:   1. Reads the ledger with msgpack.unpackb()   2. Aggregates focus_ms per payload   3. Multiplies original cosine scores by 1 + log1p(focus_ms)   4. Re-computes Precision@5.
UI bling (optional)	Toss in a pre-baked Grafana JSON; point it at ~/.aep to show a dwell-time histogram per prompt.

2 · Why this proves anything
	1.	Mergeable record – run two shells in parallel; both append to the same ledger with zero collisions (content-hash IDs).
	2.	Observability win – Grafana instantly plots LLM latency vs. human dwell-time.
	3.	Accuracy lift – the notebook’s metric delta demonstrates that knowing you actually read doc A for 8 s is actionable.

4 · Hour-by-hour plan (EST)

Time	Task	Notes
19:00–19:30	Scaffold repo: virtualenv, deps, copy LangChain RAG quick-start.	Use LangChain.load_summarize_chain example corpus if docs dump fails.
19:30–20:00	Write aep_callback.py	3 methods: on_llm_start, on_llm_end, __exit__; pack + append.
20:00–20:30	Run 20 queries manually	Ask varied questions; keep terminal visible for latency sanity check.
20:30–21:00	Notebook: parse ledger, join with retriever scores, plot metric.	40 lines incl. DuckDB query.
21:00–21:30	Grafana: import JSON, point to file data-source plugin.	Only if you want a pretty screenshot.
21:30–22:00	Docker compose: jupyter, grafana, mount ledger.	Means “git clone && up” works for anyone.
22:00–22:30	README write-up (what, how, expected output).	Include the “+11 pp” before/after screenshot.
22:30–23:00	Polish / push to GitHub	MIT licence; add small gif if time.

5 · Measurement cheat-sheet
	•	Focus weighting formula
score' = score * (1 + log1p(total_focus_ms(payload)))
(Use 1e-3 floor to avoid zero-focus divide.)
	•	Metric
Precision@5 on the mini QA set (LangChain docs include canonical Q/A pairs).
Baseline expected ≈ 0.75; with weighting target ≥ 0.85.
	•	Sanity
Histogram focus_ms—should be bimodal: <100 ms (agent calls) vs. >2 s (human reading).

6 · Context blurb for clueless collaborators

“AEP” is a four-field log format (id, ts, focus_ms, payload) that records how long a human or an agent actually looked at a chunk of data. Tonight we prove the idea by wiring a tiny tap into a LangChain retrieval app, logging exec-latency as focus_ms, then using that signal to re-rank answers. If attention really matters, accuracy jumps—and we have a ledger we can later merge with browser or Discord taps.

Kick-off command

git clone https://github.com/YOURNAME/aep-demo && cd aep-demo
docker compose up  # brings up jupyter (+ grafana if you want)

Open analysis/focus_weighting.ipynb, run all cells, and watch the metric pop.

That’s the night: one repo, one ledger, one metric bump—enough proof to keep building.
