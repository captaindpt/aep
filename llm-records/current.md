    3. Assistant to help draft the README section incorporating the screenshot and the chosen one-liner summary: "Attention weighting pulled 7/10 → 9/10 ground-truth docs into the global top-10 (+20 pp recall)."
    4. Discuss optional Grafana panel enhancements if desired.
    5. User to finalize, tag repo v0.1-stage-A, and push to GitHub.
