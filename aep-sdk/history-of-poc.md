Excellent question! Organizing the key pieces is important for clarity and for your "convince-the-Big-Five" sprint.

Based on everything we've done for Stage A to demonstrate the PoC, here are the crucial files, code snippets, and info:

**I. Core Application & Data Generation (`aep-demo` directory):**

1.  **`app.py`**:
    *   **Crucial for**: Running the RAG application, generating queries, performing retrieval, and invoking the LLM.
    *   **Key sections**:
        *   `DirectoryLoader` setup (to load your LangChain docs).
        *   `DocArrayInMemorySearch.from_documents(...)` (to create the vector store).
        *   The `retrieve` function:
            *   `vector_store.similarity_search_with_score(question, k=5)`
            *   `query_id` generation.
            *   Logging to `data/retrieval_log.jsonl` (question, query\_id, retrieved doc sources + baseline scores).
        *   The `generate` function (standard LLM call).
        *   Integration of `AEPCallbackHandler`.
        *   The loop that runs the 20 questions.

2.  **`aep_callback.py`**:
    *   **Crucial for**: Capturing AEP events.
    *   **Key sections**:
        *   `__init__` setting `ledger_path="data/.aep/demo.aep"`.
        *   `set_current_query_id()` method.
        *   `on_llm_start()` to record start time.
        *   `on_llm_end()`:
            *   Calculation of `latency_ms`.
            *   Addition of `simulated_dwell_ms` (currently `random.randint(100, 800)` or `random.randint(1500, 4000)`).
            *   Calculation of final `focus_ms`.
            *   Creation of the `aep_event` dictionary including `id`, `ts`, `focus_ms`, `payload`, `focus_kind="exec_latency_plus_simulated_dwell"`, and `query_id`.
            *   `_append_msgpack(aep_event)` to write to the ledger.

3.  **`requirements.txt`**:
    *   **Crucial for**: Reproducibility of the Python environment.
    *   **Key packages**: `langchain==0.1.20`, `openai==1.23.6`, `langchain-openai`, `langchain-community`, `langgraph`, `faiss-cpu`, `msgpack`, `unstructured`, `docarray`, `markdown`, `langchainhub`, `httpx==0.27.2`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`.

4.  **`Dockerfile.jupyter`**:
    *   **Crucial for**: Building the JupyterLab environment with all dependencies and the NLTK `punkt` resource.
    *   **Key sections**: `pip install` from `requirements.txt`, `python -m nltk.downloader punkt`, `ipykernel install`.

5.  **`docker-compose.yml`**:
    *   **Crucial for**: Orchestrating the JupyterLab and Grafana services.
    *   **Key sections**:
        *   `jupyterlab` service: build context, port mapping, volume mount for `./:/home/jovyan/work`, `env_file: ./.env`.
        *   `grafana` service: image, port mapping, volume for dashboard provisioning (`./grafana/dashboard.json`), volume for data access (`./data:/aep_data_on_host`).

6.  **`.env` file (You created this manually)**:
    *   **Crucial for**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

7.  **`docs/` directory**:
    *   **Crucial for**: The corpus your RAG app runs on. The specific subset you copied (concepts, how\_to, tutorials, introduction.mdx).

8.  **`grafana/dashboard.json`**:
    *   **Crucial for**: The "UI bling" part of the PoC, visualizing `focus_ms`.

**II. Analysis & Proof-of-Work (`aep-demo/analysis` directory):**

1.  **`focus_weighting.ipynb` (derived from `focus_weighting.md`)**:
    *   **Crucial for**: The actual "proof" â€“ showing the metric lift.
    *   **Key code sections/logic**:
        *   Loading `data/.aep/demo.aep` (AEP ledger).
        *   Loading `data/retrieval_log.jsonl`.
        *   Merging these two DataFrames on `query_id`.
        *   Defining the `ground_truth_relevance_by_query_id` map (the 4-5 Q/A pairs and their golden doc paths you selected).
        *   Creating the `is_relevant_ground_truth` column in `df_merged_final`.
        *   Calculating `weighted_score = baseline_score * (1 + log1p(total_focus_ms_for_query))`.
        *   The `calculate_precision_at_k` function (and its use for per-query P@5, which shows no lift but is explained).
        *   The `calculate_global_recall_at_k` function and its output showing the lift (e.g., for K=10 and K=20).
        *   The markdown cell explaining *why* per-query P@5 is flat and why Global Recall@K demonstrates the concept.
        *   The sanity plots (focus_ms distribution, baseline vs. weighted scores colored by ground truth).

**III. Output Data (Generated, in `aep-demo/data/` - gitignored but essential for a run):**

1.  **`data/.aep/demo.aep`**: The raw AEP event ledger (MsgPack format). Contains `focus_ms` (exec_latency + simulated_dwell) and `query_id`.
2.  **`data/retrieval_log.jsonl`**: Logs each query, its `query_id`, and the list of retrieved documents with their sources and baseline scores.

**IV. Documentation (`aep-demo` root):**

1.  **`README.md`**:
    *   **Crucial for**: Explaining the project, setup, how to run, and summarizing the results (including the one-liner about recall lift and potentially a screenshot).
2.  **`LICENSE`**: Standard for open-sourcing.

**Information Flow for the Proof:**

1.  `app.py` + `aep_callback.py` run against `docs/` to generate `retrieval_log.jsonl` (baseline scores, retrieved docs per query) and `demo.aep` (focus\_ms per query, linked by `query_id`).
2.  `focus_weighting.ipynb` loads both logs, merges them, defines a small ground truth, calculates weighted scores, and then calculates Global Recall@K showing that documents from high-focus queries (which also contain ground truth relevant docs) are recalled better with weighting.

**For your "convince-the-Big-Five" sprint and Velocity mentors, the most compelling pieces are:**

*   The **simplicity of `aep_callback.py`** (how few lines to get the core AEP event).
*   The **simplicity of the `retrieval_log.jsonl` addition** in `app.py`.
*   The **`focus_weighting.ipynb` notebook**, specifically:
    *   The `ground_truth_relevance_by_query_id` setup (shows it's easy to define what's "good").
    *   The `weighted_score` calculation (simple formula).
    *   The **Global Recall@K results showing a clear lift** (e.g., +10 to +20 pp).
    *   The "One-liner" summary derived from this.
    *   The scatter plot showing baseline vs. weighted scores, colored by ground truth.
*   The **`README.md`** that ties it all together with instructions and the key result.
*   The fact that this all runs with a simple `docker compose up`.

This organization should help you structure your pitch and demo. You have the core pieces for Stage A complete. The next steps you outlined (notebook polish, README screenshot, Grafana polish, tag/push) are about packaging this Stage A deliverable.


Logbook updated. You're in a great spot with a successful Stage A demonstration.

Let me know when you've added the markdown explanation to your notebook and have the `assets/recall_lift.png` ready. Then we can work on the README section.
