– TASK IN PROGRESS: AEP-SDK v0.1 Readiness Testing (as per 5-layer test plan)
– BLOCKERS / NOTES: 
    - User observed `BrokenPipeError` when running `analysis/run_eval.py | head`. This is expected behavior due to `head` closing the pipe and not an issue with `run_eval.py` itself. The script should run correctly without `head` or when piped to `less` or a file.
    - User to complete outstanding manual tasks:
        1. UI: Scaffold Vite project in `aep-sdk/ui/`, install npm deps, integrate provided React code, verify Vite dev proxy (`vite.config.ts`).
        2. QA Set: ✅ Completed – curated to 110 questions, renamed to `qa/qa.yaml`, evaluation recall 0.7591 (pass).
        3. Notebook: Convert `aep-sdk/analysis/eval_notebook_content.md` to `analysis/eval.ipynb` using `analysis/convert_notebook.py`.
        4. Commit `poetry.lock` to repository.
    - The `analysis/convert_notebook.py` script is ready. Its primary function (MD to IPYNB) should work. A known limitation with `jupytext 1.17.1` (user's version) means IPYNB to MD conversion may not include cell outputs in the MD file.
    - Conda environment for `analysis/eval.ipynb`: User to ensure `analysis/environment.yml` is used to create/update the `aep-analysis` conda environment and the kernel is installed, if not done already.
    - After manual tasks and notebook conversion/setup are complete, user to proceed through the 5-layer readiness test outlined in `plan.md`.
– NEXT SMALL STEP: User to ensure all prerequisite manual tasks (UI, poetry.lock), notebook conversion, and Conda environment setup are complete. Then, proceed with Layer 1 (Python unit tests) of readiness testing from `plan.md` by running `poetry run pytest -q`.

– TASK IN PROGRESS: User to test `convert_notebook.py` and proceed with AEP-SDK v0.1 Readiness Testing.
- BLOCKERS / NOTES: User needs to install `jupytext` (`poetry add jupytext` or `pip install jupytext`).
- NEXT SMALL STEP: User to convert `analysis/eval_notebook_content.md` to `analysis/eval.ipynb` using the new script.

– TASK IN PROGRESS: User to set up Conda environment and Jupyter kernel for `analysis/eval.ipynb`.
– BLOCKERS / NOTES: User needs to follow the provided instructions to create the Conda env, activate it, install local `aep-sdk`, and install the Jupyter kernel.
– NEXT SMALL STEP: User to run `conda env create -f analysis/environment.yml` and subsequent setup commands.

– TASK IN PROGRESS: Finalize `analysis/convert_notebook.py` focusing on MD-to-IPYNB and acknowledge IPYNB-to-MD (with output) limitations.
– BLOCKERS / NOTES: 
    - `jupytext 1.17.1` does not appear to write outputs to text-based formats (`md:myst`, `py:percent`) as expected, even with `outputs=True`.
    - Primary goal: Convert `eval_notebook_content.md` -> `eval.ipynb` (this should work).
    - Secondary goal: Convert `eval.ipynb` (with outputs) -> `eval.md` (with outputs). This is currently problematic with `jupytext 1.17.1`.
– NEXT SMALL STEP: Modify `analysis/convert_notebook.py` to:
    1. Reliably handle MD-to-IPYNB conversion.
    2. Keep the IPYNB-to-MD conversion attempt (to `md:myst`, `outputs=True`) but with awareness of its current limitations for output inclusion given jupytext 1.17.1.

– TASK IN PROGRESS: Modify `analysis/convert_notebook.py` script for correct output handling.
– BLOCKERS / NOTES: 
    - When converting IPYNB to MD, cell outputs must be included (using `md:myst` format).
    - When converting MD (plain) to IPYNB, outputs should not be generated/included from the MD itself.
– NEXT SMALL STEP: Edit `analysis/convert_notebook.py` to adjust `jupytext.write` options for IPYNB-to-MD.

– TASK IN PROGRESS: User to re-test modified `analysis/convert_notebook.py` (with `outputs=True`).
– BLOCKERS / NOTES: 
    - Test IPYNB to MD conversion: ensure cell outputs (like tracebacks) are now present in the MyST MD file.
    - Test MD to IPYNB conversion: `analysis/eval_notebook_content.md` to `.ipynb` should still produce no outputs initially.
– NEXT SMALL STEP: User to run conversion tests with the newly updated script.

– TASK IN PROGRESS: Add verbose logging to `analysis/convert_notebook.py` for debugging output handling.
– BLOCKERS / NOTES: 
    - Current attempts to include outputs in IPYNB-to-MD conversion are not working as expected by the user.
    - Adding detailed print statements will help trace the script's logic and parameters passed to `jupytext`.
– NEXT SMALL STEP: Modify the script to include more logging, then have the user re-test and provide the new script output.

– TASK IN PROGRESS: Diagnose output omission by forcing `fmt="notebook"` in `analysis/convert_notebook.py`.
– BLOCKERS / NOTES: 
    - Outputs (like tracebacks) are still not appearing in the `.md` file despite `md:myst` and `outputs=True`.
    - Changing format to `notebook` will embed raw IPYNB JSON into the MD, helping to verify if `jupytext` can serialize the outputs at all.
    - The resulting `.md` will not be human-readable Markdown but is for diagnosis.
– NEXT SMALL STEP: Modify the script, then have the user re-test and inspect the raw content of the `eval.md` for the error output within the embedded JSON.

– TASK IN PROGRESS: Inspect in-memory notebook object after `jupytext.read()` in `analysis/convert_notebook.py`.
– BLOCKERS / NOTES: 
    - Outputs (tracebacks) are still not appearing in `eval.md` even with `fmt="notebook"` (raw JSON embed).
    - This suggests `jupytext.read()` might not be loading outputs from `eval.ipynb` correctly, or `eval.ipynb` itself might not have outputs saved as expected.
    - We will add print statements to show the content of `cell.outputs` for each cell after `jupytext.read()`.
– NEXT SMALL STEP: Modify the script to print cell outputs, then have the user re-test and provide the new script output focusing on the in-memory representation.

– TASK IN PROGRESS: Attempt to write outputs to `md:myst` format in `analysis/convert_notebook.py`.
– BLOCKERS / NOTES: 
    - Confirmed `jupytext.read()` loads outputs correctly.
    - The issue likely lies in how `jupytext.write()` renders these to `md:myst`.
    - Reverting to `md:myst` with `outputs=True` and removing detailed in-memory inspection.
– NEXT SMALL STEP: Modify the script, then have the user re-test and carefully inspect the content of `eval.md` (as plain text) for the MyST representation of the error output.

– TASK IN PROGRESS: User to meticulously inspect raw `eval.md` for MyST-formatted error outputs.
– BLOCKERS / NOTES: 
    - Confirmed `jupytext.read()` loads outputs, and `jupytext.write()` is called with `md:myst` and `outputs=True`.
    - The traceback is likely present in `eval.md` but in a MyST-specific format (e.g., YAML block after code cell) that might be missed or misinterpreted.
– NEXT SMALL STEP: User to open `eval.md` in a plain text editor, locate the error-producing cell, and look for the `---` separated YAML block containing the `output_type: error` and `traceback`.

– TASK IN PROGRESS: Diagnose `jupytext.write` failure with `md:myst`. Request jupytext version and try "percent" format.
– BLOCKERS / NOTES: 
    - Confirmed outputs are read into memory but NOT written to `eval.md` with `md:myst` and `outputs=True`.
    - Issue is likely with `jupytext.write` for `md:myst` in the user's environment or a jupytext version-specific problem.
– NEXT SMALL STEP: 
    1. User to provide their `jupytext --version`.
    2. Modify `analysis/convert_notebook.py` to attempt writing to "percent" format (`.py` file) to see if outputs are written to *any* text format.
